# EmojiTranslator
Final Year Project - The University of Manchester 2019 

This application takes both textual and emoji input and returns a translation of the sentence. 
An aim of this project was increase accessibility of emoji use for those who are visually impaired.

This project was super fun to work on as it was the first Android application I had created from scratch. 
I learnt a great deal through this project.
